        <p>This is the second article in a three-part series on LevelDB and how it can be used in Node.</p>
<ul class="parts">
  <li><a href="http://dailyjs.com/2013/04/19/leveldb-and-node-1/">Part 1: What is LevelDB Anyway?</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://dailyjs.com/2013/05/03/leveldb-and-node-2/"><strong>Part 2: Getting Up and Running</strong></a></li>
</ul>

<p>Our first article covered the basics of LevelDB and its internals. If you haven&#39;t already read it you are encouraged to do so as we will be building upon this knowledge as we introduce the Node interface in this article.</p>
<p><img src="http://dailyjs.com/images/posts/leveldb.png" alt="LevelDB"></p>
<p>There are two primary libraries for using LevelDB in Node, <strong><a href="https://github.com/rvagg/node-leveldown">LevelDOWN</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://github.com/rvagg/node-levelup">LevelUP</a></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>LevelDOWN</strong> is a pure C++ interface between Node.js and LevelDB. Its API provides limited <em>sugar</em> and is mostly a straight-forward mapping of LevelDB&#39;s operations into JavaScript. All I/O operations in LevelDOWN are asynchronous and take advantage of LevelDB&#39;s thread-safe nature to parallelise reads and writes.</p>
<p><strong>LevelUP</strong> is the library that the majority of people will use to interface with LevelDB in Node. It wraps LevelDOWN to provide a more Node.js-style interface. Its API provides more <em>sugar</em> than LevelDOWN, with features such as optional arguments.</p>
<p>LevelUP exposes iterators as Node.js-style object streams. A LevelUP <strong>ReadStream</strong> can be used to read sequential entries, forward or reverse, to and from any key.</p>
<p>LevelUP handles JSON and other encoding types for you. For example, when operating on a LevelUP instance with JSON value-encoding, you simply pass in your objects for writes and they are serialised for you. Likewise, when you read them, they are deserialised and passed back in their original form.</p>

        <p>This is the first article in a three-part series on LevelDB and how it can be used in Node.</p>
<p>This article will cover the LevelDB basics and internals to provide a foundation for the next two articles. The second and third articles will cover the core LevelDB Node libraries: <a href="https://github.com/rvagg/node-levelup">LevelUP</a>, <a href="https://github.com/rvagg/node-leveldown">LevelDOWN</a> and the rest of the LevelDB ecosystem that&#39;s appearing in Node-land.</p>

<h3>What is LevelDB?</h3>
<p>LevelDB is an <em>open-source</em>, <em>dependency-free</em>, <em>embedded key/value data store</em>. It was developed in 2011 by Jeff Dean and Sanjay Ghemawat, researchers from Google. It&#39;s written in C++ although it has third-party bindings for most common programming languages. Including JavaScript / Node.js of course.</p>
<p>LevelDB is based on ideas in Google&#39;s BigTable but does not share code with BigTable, this allows it to be licensed for open source release. Dean and Ghemawat developed LevelDB as a replacement for SQLite as the backing-store for Chrome&#39;s IndexedDB implementation.</p>
<p>It has since seen very wide adoption across the industry and serves as the back-end to a number of new databases and is now the recommended storage back-end for Riak.</p>

        <p>I visited lovely Dublin last month to attend <a href="http://peerconf.com/">PeerConf</a>. While there I got to meet a great bunch of Irish programmers at <a href="http://www.nodejsdublin.com/">Node.js Dublin</a>, a semi-regular Node.js meet-up that happens in the <a href="https://www.engineyard.com/">Engine Yard</a> office in Dublin.</p>
<p>I was invited to give a presentation on LevelDB and the work that I&#39;ve been doing on it in Node.js. I was followed by <a href="https://github.com/dominictarr">Dominic Tarr</a> who&#39;s doing some amazing work on top of LevelDB.</p>
<p>You can view my slides <a href="http://r.va.gg/presentations/nodejsdub/">here</a> but a written version is currently being spread over 3 parts on <a href="http://dailyjs.com">DailyJS</a>. More about that soon!</p>

      <div class="post-meta">
        <p class="byline">by Rod Vagg on September 8, 2012</p>

        <p>In my <a href="http://rod.vagg.org/2012/08/bean_v1/" title="Towards Bean v1.0 (or: How event managers do their thing)">previous post</a> about Bean I discussed in detail the work that has gone in to a v1 release and how it will differ from the v0.4 branch.</p>
<p>Bean version 1.0.0 has now been released, you can download it from the <a href="https://github.com/fat/bean">GitHub repository</a> or you can fetch it from <a href="https://npmjs.org/package/bean">npm</a> for your Ender builds.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a quick summary of the changes, but for a more in-depth look you should refer to my <a href="http://rod.vagg.org/2012/08/bean_v1/" title="Towards Bean v1.0 (or: How event managers do their thing)">previous post</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b><code>on()</code> argument ordering</b>: the new signature is now <code>.on(events[, selector], handlerFn)</code>, which will work on both Bean as a standalone library and when bundled in Ender. In Ender, the following aliases also pass through <code>on()</code> so the same arguments work: <code>addListener()</code>, <code>bind()</code>, <code>listen()</code> and <code>one()</code> (which of course will only trigger once). Plus all the specific shortcuts such as <code>click()</code>, <code>keyup()</code> etc. although these methods have the first argument hardwired.</p>
<p><code>add()</code> is left intact with the same argument ordering for standalone Bean and <code>delegate()</code> has the same signature, the same as jQuery&#39;s equivalent.</p>
<p><b><code>off()</code> is the new <code>remove()</code></b>: although <code>remove()</code> is still available in standalone Bean.</p>
<p><b>Bean attaches a single handler to the DOM for each event type on each element</b>: as outlined above, Bean will iterate over all handlers for each triggered and (mostly) reuse the same Event object for each call.</p>
<p><b><code>Event.stopImmediatePropagation()</code>:</b> is available across all supported browsers, it will stop the processing of all handlers for the current event at the current element (i.e. the event will still bubble).</p>
<p><b>The selector engine argument to <code>add()</code> is now completely removed</b>: you used to have to pass a selector engine in as the last argument for delegated events. Now you must set it once at start-up with <code>setSelectorEngine()</code>. This is automatically taken care of for you in an Ender build.</p>
<p><b>A duplicate-handler check is no longer performed when you <i>add</i></b>: performance testing showed that this was a massive slow-down and is simply not something that Bean should be responsible for. If you want to add the same handler twice then that&#39;s your business and responsibility.</p>
<p><b>Namespace matching for event <code>fire()</code>ing now matches namespaces using an <i>and</i> instead of an <code>or</code>:</b> so for example, firing namespaces &#39;a.b&#39; will fire any event with <i>both</i> &#39;a&#39; and &#39;b&#39; rather than <i>either</i> &#39;a&#39; or &#39;b&#39;. This is compatible with jQuery and is arguably a much more sensible and helpful way to deal with namespaces. You can find some discussion on this <a href="https://github.com/fat/bean/pull/68">on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p><b>Lots of internal improvements for speed, code size, etc.</b>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There was one remaining question to be resolved&mdash;whether <code>Event.stop()</code> would also trigger <code>Event.stopImmediatePropagation()</code>. I&#39;ve decided to <b>not</b> include it and leave it to the user to decide whether they want to prevent triggering of other listeners on the same event/element.</p>
<p>And that&#39;s it! Please give it a spin and open an issue on GitHub if you have any bugs to report or questions to be answered.</p>

      <h2 id="ender-bundling"><a href="/2012/08/ender-bundling.html">How Ender bundles libraries for the browser</a></h2>

        <p>I was asked an interesting Ender question on IRC (#enderjs on Freenode) and as I was answering it, it occurred to me that the subject would be an ideal way to explain how Ender&#39;s multi-library bundling works. So here is that explanation!</p><p>The original question went something like this:</p><blockquote><p>When a browser first visits my page, they only get served Bonzo (a DOM manipulation library) as a stand-alone library, but on returning visits they are also served Qwery (a selector engine), Bean (an event manager) and a few other modules in an Ender build. Can I integrate Bonzo into the Ender build on the browser for repeat visitors?</p></blockquote><h3>Wait, what&#39;s Ender?</h3><p>Let&#39;s step back a bit and start with some basics. The way I generally explain Ender to people is that it&#39;s two different things:</p><ol><li>It&#39;s a build tool, for bundling JavaScript libraries together into a single file. The resulting file constitutes a new &quot;framework&quot; based around the jQuery-style DOM element collection pattern: <code>$(&#39;selector&#39;).method()</code>. The constituent libraries provide the functionality for the <em>methods</em> and may also provide the selector engine functionality.</li><li>It&#39;s an <em>ecosystem</em> of JavaScript libraries. Ender promotes a small collection of libraries as a base, called <strong>The Jeesh</strong>, which together provide a large portion of the functionality normally required of a JavaScript framework, but there are many more libraries compatible with Ender that add extra functionality. Many of the libraries available for Ender are also usable outside of Ender as stand-alone libraries.</li></ol><p><em><strong>Continue reading this article on <a href="http://dailyjs.com/2012/08/23/ender-tutorial/">DailyJS.com</a></strong></em></p>
